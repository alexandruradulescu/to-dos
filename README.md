This is a simple tasks exercise.

You can run the project directly after cloning it. It has the compiled files included.

In order to setup the build system:
1. You will need npm installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run "npm install" (depending on the OS and your account type, you might need to run it as admin)
4. Run "gulp" in a terminal opened in the project folder.

The gulp will automatically compile all the files, whevever any changes take place, as long as the code is correct.
